# React Mini Projects

This repository contains two mini projects built using React: a Recursive File Explorer and a Stopwatch. These projects demonstrate essential functionalities and provide a foundation for further development in React.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Recursive File Explorer

#### Description

The Recursive File Explorer is a dynamic application that allows users to manage files and folders within a hierarchical structure. Users can create, delete, and rename files and folders, navigating through nested directories seamlessly.

#### Features

- **Delete Files and Folders:** Remove files and folders as needed.
- **Rename Files and Folders:** Change the names of files and folders.
- **Recursive Navigation:** Navigate through nested folders intuitively.

#### Usage

To start using the Recursive File Explorer, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the development server. Detailed instructions are provided in the individual project README.

### 2. Stopwatch

#### Description

The Stopwatch application is a simple yet effective tool for measuring elapsed time. It includes functionalities to start, stop, reset the timer, and record lap times, making it suitable for various timing needs.

#### Features

- **Start/Stop:** Control the stopwatch to start and stop the timer.
- **Reset:** Reset the stopwatch to zero.
- **Lap Times:** Record and display lap times.
- **Time Display:** Show elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

#### Usage

To use the Stopwatch, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the development server. Detailed instructions are provided in the individual project README.
